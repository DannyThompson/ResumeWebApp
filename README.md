# ResumeWebApp
Forked From professor from Database class. Used in conjunction with our SQL database to make a simple Resume Web app.

Final Product. Due to time constraints, I was unable to fix one bug: In Resume View by ID, if ANY of the variables has multiple values, every variable will be displayed the amount of times.

For example, if the person has two skills, and went to 3 companies,

every variable will be listed 3 times.
